                        The Life Choices Academy is a full-time program which empowers youth from the Cape Flats with
                        life, practical and professional development skills. We did intensive study of the following web
                        development languages: HTML, CSS, SASS, jQuery, JavaScript, Node and MongoDB. As part of our
                        professional development, we had the opportunity to use online resources such as MOOCs, were
                        taught Design Thinking and made use of resources for personal reflection, such as DISC profiles
                        and SMART goal setting. Taking part in this program has made me aware of my weaknesses and
                        helped me dramatically improve my ability to use my weaknesses in my stead whilst gradually
                        turning them into strengths.
